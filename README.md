# EFFECIENT RAILWAY TRACK CLEANING SYSTEM 
Traditionally, track cleaning is carried out using manual labor or conventional 
machines, which are time-consuming, costly, and often unsafe for workers. With 
advancements in automation and embedded systems, there is a growing need for 
efficient, reliable, and energy-saving maintenance solutions. This project focuses 
on the development of an energy-effective automated railway track cleaning 
mechanism using an Arduino-based control system. The project involves an energy-effective automated railway track cleaning 
mechanism that uses an Arduino-controlled system to remove dust and debris 
from railway tracks. It is portable, cost-effective, and reduces manual labor while 
improving safety, efficiency, and sustainable railway maintenance. The Arduino-based cleaner successfully removes dust and debris from the 
tracks. Ultrasonic and IR sensors workes well for obstacle and track detection. Motors and brushes operates effectively, powered reliably by the 12V 
battery. Arduino controlls the system accurately, responding to obstacles and track changes.
By 
using an Arduino-based control system, motors, sensors, and a batterypowered setup, the prototype is able to move along the track, detect obstacles, 
and collect waste effectively.
